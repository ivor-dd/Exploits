# exploits

**A CTF suite in progress.**

## Setting up the enviroment

Run these commands in bash to setup a virtual enviroment and install the neccessary requirements. 

```
python3 -m venv exploit-env
source exploit-env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
deactivate
```

## Running commands

All commands can be run without the virtual enviorment activated and from anywhere. This is due to the shebang.

```
#!/usr/bin/perl -e$_=$ARGV[0];exec(s{\w+$}{../exploit-env/bin/python3}r,@ARGV)
```

The enviroment is selected relative to the script being called - so be sure to create your enviroment in the exploit (top level) folder.
However if you are not on linux you may have to take a more traditional approach.

### Padding Oracle

#### Description
This attack is useful for the decryption and encryption of urls that exhibit a padding error due to the encryption operating in CBC mode and a clear response difference when padding is correct and when it is not (in this case status code and response length is the differentiator).

#### Usage

#### Decryption

```
./padding-oracle/pad_encrypter http://path_to_attack_vector/?post= 'encrypted_part_of_URL' block_size 
```

#### Encryption

```
./padding-oracle/pad_encrypter http://path_to_attack_vector/?post= 'encrypted_part_of_URL' block_size 'message_that_you_want_to_encrypt'
```
